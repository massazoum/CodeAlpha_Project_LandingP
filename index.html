     <div> <p>At its big Tuesday event, not only did Apple unveil its new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro line-ups, but it stressed environmental bona fides and its efforts toward becoming carbon neutral by 2030. It also introduced the Apple Watch Series 9, an Apple Watch Ultra 2, and offered  noteworthy commitments regarding its future corporate environmental responsibility.

      In other news, iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, tvOS 17, and HomePod 17 will be available as free updates on Sept. 18; macOS Sonoma ships a little later, on Sept. 26.And as expected, Apple’s iPhones, watches, and AirPods Pro will be among the first of its mobile products to be equipped with USB-C, in line with EU regulation. EarPods will also migrate to USB-C.</p></div>

      <div> <p>In early 2022, Microsoft announced its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, which prompted a legal battle with the FTC. Among other interesting documents, the US Courts just released a few internal emails from Microsoft employees in 2021 talking about PC games coming to Xbox Cloud Gaming. 

        These emails appear to be in response to the threat of Google’s Stadia service, which has since been shut down. The emails between leadership from Microsoft and Xbox discuss the possibility of using its Azure servers to stream PC games over Xbox Cloud Gaming. Even though the threat of Stadia’s existence is no longer there, we hope Microsoft pushes forward with allowing PC games to be streamed via the cloud.</p></div>

     <h3>NVIDIA</h3>
     <p>This device is an external GPU enclosure with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 inside. What's more, ASUS isn't relying on Thunderbolt for this external GPU but instead created its own solution with a custom PCIe 3.0 x8 interface that hooks it directly into the CPU. It's also capable of keeping the laptop powered. This thing will be rapid fast.</p>
